# Facial Emotion Recognition Model

This repository contains the implementation for **Task 1: Facial Emotion Recognition**, developed during my **Machine Learning Internship at Learnflow Services**.

## 🚀 Overview

The objective of this project was to build a robust model capable of identifying facial emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger, and more from images or videos. This notebook showcases the entire process, from data preprocessing to model evaluation.
